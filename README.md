## Repository Description

This repository is part of a master's thesis in the field of software engineering. The aim of the project is to investigate how artificial intelligence can be used to learn meaningful representations of source code changes.

The project consists of two modules described in the thesis, each with its own README file including usage instructions:

- [**`ccrep_modified`**](./ccrep_modified/) – A modification of the state-of-the-art solution **CCRep**, which uses the Query Back mechanism to learn representations of source code changes.

- [**`ra_framework`**](./ra_framework/) – A custom framework designed to explore the approach proposed in the thesis, based on the **Retrieval Augmentation** mechanism, which has not previously been used in the context of code change representation.
